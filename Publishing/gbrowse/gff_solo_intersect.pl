=head1 NAME

gff_solo_intersect.pl - Intersect overlapping intervals within a sorted, SINGLE GFF3 file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

gff_solo_intersect.pl --trackid=ID [--verbose] [GFF3]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finds all overlapping intervals in GFF3 or STDIN and prints, to STDOUT, a new GFF3 with all
overlapping intervals intersected.

Specify --verbose for additional messages printed to STDERR.

CAUTION: The GFF3 produced by this script is sorted by column 4 in ascending order, BUT
only within the context of a single chromosome. Col 4 is NOT sorted across the entire file.

Motivation: overlapping peaks found within individual biological replicates 
for Snyder GFP ChIP experiments. This could not be solved using the traditional "bedtools intersect"
approach because there are already overlaps within one file.

=head1 EXAMPLES

gff_solo_intersect.pl myFeatures.GFF3
	myFeatures.GFF3 is already sorted, you're good to go.
gff_solo_intersect.pl <(cat unsortedFeatures.GFF3 | sort -g -k4)
	Little extra work here, features need to be sorted first.

#											.
#											.

# 						[INT_START, INT_END, INT_SCORE, BOOL_MERGED]
#			  ]

# 	"CHR2" => [
# 						[INT_START, INT_END, INT_SCORE, BOOL_MERGED]
# 						[INT_START, INT_END, INT_SCORE, BOOL_MERGED]
