Script to map GFF files bewteen various Wormbase releases

remap_gff_between_releases.pl - map forwards e.g. from version 150 to 160
unmap_gff_between_releases.pl - map backwards e.g. from version 160 back to 150 (not maintained, not used much)

CHROMOSOME_DIFFERENCES/ - directory of mapping data files
test.gff - example input GFF file
test.out - example output GFF file

Input file
----------

This script expects to read in a GFF file.
See original GFF definition: http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/GFF_Spec.shtml
See the GFF3 definition:     http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml

The first column must specify the C. elegans chromosome, as one of: 
I, II, III, IV, V, X

(You may also specify it as the common variants: CHROMOSOME_I, and chrI)
No other sequence-IDs in the first column are recognised.

Comment lines starting with a # character are passed through unchanged.

Embedded Fasta format sequences at the end of the file are passed
through unchanged.

Output file
-----------

This script outputs a GFF file.

The start, end and sense columns will be changed to remap regions
between the specified releases.

The attribute field (the 9th column) will not be changed, so any
positions or alignment (Gap= CIGAR;) data specified here will NOT be
remapped.

Usage
-----

To map from 150 to 160:

perl remap_gff_between_releases.pl -gff test.gff -out test.out -release1 150 -release2 160

If an object specified in the GFF file has a genomic change within it,
then the changed line will be output to the screen, the object will
probablymight now have an erroneous structure now and should be
investigated.

Unmapping
---------

For mapping positions back to an older release of the genome, there is
a script 'unmap_gff_between_releases.pl'. It is not expected that this
script will be used very much and it is not maintained.

To map from 160 back to 150:
perl unmap_gff_between_releases.pl -gff test.gff -out test.out -release1 150 -release2 160
